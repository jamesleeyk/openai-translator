They say "You reap what you sow."
Naturally, readers were disgusted and turned away by the sudden and forced development. But at the time, I thought it was the best option. Of course, maybe it would have been better to continue what I was doing and run away all year round, but back then, there was an obsession to bring the story to a close somehow.

If you play around, you pay the price.
Because of the insane development, I found myself in a situation where I had to eat the shit I had sown. Whether I liked it or not, I was thrown into a world where chaos was approaching by the minute through that gate.

I had three choices.
Ignore whether the gate opens or not and wait in a safe place until the ending arrives.
Prepare myself so that I can fight in that situation before the gate opens.
And lastly.
Use the "delete" function to eliminate the situation where the gate opens.

The second choice might be possible without becoming a Templar, but for the third choice, I had to join the main story for achievement points.
Having already experienced multiple life-threatening moments in the prologue, I didn't have the confidence to fight and watch others die. So, I couldn't choose to prepare for the gate incident. That's why I wanted to choose the cowardly option of crossing the river and watching from a safe distance.
Even if it's cowardly, life is precious.
But Sarkagar, Royar, and Eleris pushed me forward. As each of my excuses was met with resistance, I eventually had no choice but to give up.
No matter what, if this reality I found myself in is the shit I've caused, then I should take some responsibility. It may be impossible to take full responsibility, but if there's anything I can do in the given situation, I should at least try.

I don't know if it's possible to delete the situation where the gate opens through the "delete" function. It's probably assumed to be impossible. But even if that's the case, I can become stronger through achievement points and fight off as many monsters coming out of the gate as possible.

So anyway, whether by choice or force, I have to somehow change the future of this world that only I know.
"Phew...."
I arrived at the first page of the main story.
The Templar.
Becoming the strongest on the continent, deleting the situation where the gate opens, or ending up as a mediocre talent. So, I, who couldn't even do what I liked properly, have to put in effort for something I don't even particularly enjoy?
It's infuriating.

* * *

The Templar is divided into three sections: primary education, middle education, and high education. It consists of six years in elementary, three years in middle, and six years in high school.
Indeed. In addition to that, there is a graduate school that is responsible for education after that.
Of course, there were numerous subsidiary facilities and various plots of land used for special purposes scattered around. Including sports stadiums and other special facilities such as concert halls.
Naturally, with such a large area to cover on foot, there was a separate tram line that operated only within the grounds. It was free to use, of course.
Upon entering the Templar for the first time, I was able to access the interior of the Templar with my admission permit and pre-issued student ID.
The vast campus of the Templar stretched out before me under the blue sky. It didn't quite feel like I was bringing the images in my head to life.
"Huh."
It was so much grander, larger, and cleaner than I had imagined that my mouth couldn't close. The limited descriptions that had appeared in my mind could never capture the full scale of it.
Standing at the entrance, amidst the students in various school uniforms, I stood there dumbfounded, unsure whether to call it awe or astonishment in my thoughts.
Since there are many schools in the Templar, I had set different school uniforms, but seeing the actual variety made me feel indescribable.

The sculptures and lampposts placed throughout the elaborately designed paths that resembled a huge park, as well as the educational facilities scattered around, felt more like individual works of art than schools.
And the trams quietly ran along the routes within the vast grounds.
It was a blend of classic and modern, and even a sense of chaos that perhaps only I could feel.
This isn't the time for admiration. Let's save it for later.
The place I need to go is the Royal Class dormitory located on the grounds of the high education facility.
With over 100,000 people being students, it's inevitable that there would be an immense number of dormitory facilities.
The Royal Class of the high education department consists of about 20 students per grade, and since there are six grades in the high school department, the total number comes to around 120.
It's a relatively small number. It also implies that talented individuals are rare.
So, the class I will be admitted to will have an average of ten students each. Combined with Class A and Class B, there will be about twenty students. If I am an additional member, then there will be twenty-one, or maybe even more.
As stated in the guidebook, I got off at the designated place on the internal circular tram line.
Right after getting off, I saw the grand entrance lined with columns and the dormitory building at the end.
The seven-story dormitory building was hard to comprehend, knowing that it housed only 120 residents.
It's unbelievably huge. They simply wrote "Great privilege!" as if it's no big deal, but seeing it with my own eyes, it's hard to believe it's allowed.
I mean, it's so big. Even high-ranking nobles wouldn't be able to live in a place like this, right?
Writing novels brings both joy and suffering due to the numerous events that happen because of it.
I walked through those columns and unwittingly began to feel tense as I passed through the regular patterns of shadows. It felt like I was entering a place I shouldn't be.
If I were to feel like this every day, it would actually become burdensome. I feel more at ease near Eleris' Scroll Shop in Bronzegate, even though it's not as luxurious as the underground sewers or anything.
As I stood at the entrance of the dormitory at the end of the columns, I saw the dome-shaped high ceiling and the marble staircase leading up to the upper floors.
The lobby is designed as a common area, with staircases on both sides that lead to the first and second floors. I know this because I've set it up.
On each floor, the students are assigned by grade, with the first floor housing the first-year students, the second floor housing the second-year students, and so on.
It was said that as the grade gets higher, the students become more annoyed with each other. Of course, there are elevators-like contraptions, operated by levitation magic or something similar. That thing in the center of the dome seemed to be an elevator.
Based on the perspective of facing the building, the left side is Class A, and the right side is Class B. All the students living on the left side of the building belong to Class A, regardless of their grade, and the same goes for the right side and Class B.

From here on, I roughly know what will happen.

"You're a freshman, right?"
"Yes, that's right."
A senior student wearing the same uniform as me approached, holding a folder. The person wearing the female uniform...
"I'm Sarees Van Owens, the 5th-year student council president of the Royal Class. Nice to meet you."
"Oh, yes. Nice to meet you."
Yeah, that's how it goes. While there is a student council president and vice president for the entire high education department, each school also has its own student council president and vice president.
So, even within the Royal Class, they have their own student council president and vice president. Since the number of students they manage is immense, their authority is formidable. With the high education student population exceeding tens of thousands in the first place.
But the Royal Class student council, with a total number that doesn't even reach 1% of the entire student population, also holds significant influence. It's because they are one of the two top-notch classes.
Of course, due to the relatively small number of members, the Royal Class student council can only focus on minor affairs.
Alright.
Let's say there's a freshman orientation going on.
No matter how much recognition they receive from the outside, the Royal Class struggles with a shortage of staff within.
The senior student who introduced herself as the student council president handed me my student ID, and I checked my name on the documents she held.
"Reinhardt, no middle name... you're in 1-A class. You've been assigned Room A-11. Let's get along well from now on."
"Oh, yes."
She reached out her hand, and I shook it. As a fifth-year student in high school, she's already an adult since she's 21 years old.
Since the student council president will be in her graduating class next year and will be busy, we probably won't have much interaction. But there's no need to make a bad impression either.
Regardless of actual ability, the student council president of the Royal Class holds significant power right after the staff members in this dormitory. They have substantial authority. She said to me with a bright smile.
"Once everyone arrives, we'll gather in the central lobby for a brief welcome party and to go over various notices. You can take a break and relax for now after organizing your belongings, but try not to fall into a deep sleep even if you do sleep. Got it?"
"Yes."

I dragged my suitcase down the left corridor. The sunlight pouring in from the windows and the accompanying shadows were cast on the floor like a net. It was a landscape I couldn't have imagined experiencing in my life.
As I passed through the main lobby, the dedicated lobby for 1-A class appeared. It was smaller than before, but it had sofas and tables where you could sit and a decent-sized hall with reading stands.
Though in the opposite position, in this space for Class B, students gather to have snacks, chat, and engage in various playful activities.
As it was said, there were corridors leading to various facilities such as the dormitory, magic research lab, library, indoor training ground, and dining hall. This place served as a kind of hub, with the main hub being the lobby.
Although there are cases where some facilities are added as the grades go up, the basic structure is usually similar.

Now that I'm finally in a place I know well in this world, I feel more at ease, but the detailed aspects still feel unfamiliar and awkward.
It's a complex feeling that's difficult to express.
I entered the corridor leading to the dormitory and headed to Room A-11. Just by tagging my student ID, the door opened immediately. It's not surprising anymore, but it's still quite remarkable.
Because, well, magic can make anything happen.
The room was quite spacious for one person. It had a neatly arranged bed, a spacious wardrobe, and a window. There was even an indoor shower facility. The interior of the room wasn't overly extravagant, but it was designed with a clean and modern feel. I actually prefer it this way. Too much extravagance hurts the eyes.
For now, the room only had the basic amenities, but additional facilities can be added to this expansive room according to the students' needs. Exercise equipment for physical training, magic research desks, or anything else Temple can provide. If you're entering this room, everything will be prepared.
Don't worry about anything else, just focus on cultivating your talents. It's the best environment for that.

When I opened the wardrobe, numerous uniforms custom-made to fit my measurements were already filled inside. Temple's regular students are provided with services beyond their dreams.
I took out my belongings from the suitcase and organized them in the wardrobe. After all, most of the necessary things will be provided on demand.
I didn't bring many belongings with me.
The only things I always carry with me are the ring of Dreadfind and the Flame of Tuesday, just in case.

After quickly organizing my belongings, I lay down on the bed.
I don't know how many people have arrived before me, but when I got off the magical train at the Royal Class dormitory station, I was the only one. When everyone has arrived, according to the student council's call, both Class A and Class B members will gather and meet face-to-face. It's called a welcome party, but it's probably just a simple greeting, not really a full-blown party.
There, I will see all the characters I have written.

But there's something bothering me.
My room.
Room A-11.
Temple, with its love for rankings and competition, doesn't randomly assign room numbers. Being assigned to Room A-11 means that the school authority sees my talent as the worst among the first-year Class A students.
Yeah, just becoming a part of Class A itself is a miracle. Even though I don't have any talents yet and just have infinite potential.

The Royal Class of Temple, where only the best gather, and within them, the division between Class A and Class B. And then, there's me, the bottom of Class A.

What is this?
I can already imagine how conflicts will arise in the future.

Ah, so you're talking about the "infinite potential" that I've only heard about? Haha. But this soft and flabby body is being honest, you know?
Hey, hey, have you already become weak?

You think you're Class A? How did that happen?
Listening to these nonsense words.
Huh.
I'd rather be class 1 of Class B.
No, if I were there, would I be reprimanded by the superior numbers behind me?
I don't like being last, and I don't like being first either. This situation itself is ridiculous.
And for better or worse, I'm not seeing anyone who got pushed down because of me.
I originally set both Class A and Class B to have 10 students each, so being number 11 means that I entered as an additional member beyond the original capacity.
Shouldn't at least one troublemaker have been omitted? I can't remember who dropped out when I entered.
No, maybe it's possible that one by one, the most important person got pushed out. It's a relief that I'm beyond the capacity.
I saw a few people getting off the magical train that was visible in the distance. It seemed like they were slowly arriving, one by one.
If my guess is correct...
There will definitely be events that deviate significantly from the beginning.
I wonder how things will unfold.

I took out the prepared notebook and stationery.
Let's organize the thoughts in my mind. It might be difficult to remember everything, and there's a possibility that I won't even remember the air-like ones, the ones that were only in the notes and felt insignificant. Although I did set up profiles for all 20 characters, not all of them played important roles. Including all 20 characters in a meaningful way would make the story a mess.

Of course, at the point when the gate opens in the middle, it became something more than just a mess.

Anyway.
Class A and Class B.

I need to organize the profiles of all the characters as I remember them.
One, two, three.
"......."
Once it goes over seven, I can't recall them well.
My memory is legendary....

With that in mind, I struggled to remember and organize the names and faceless names. Fortunately, even if I couldn't remember the names, I had a vague idea of what kind of characters they were.
* * *

The afternoon grew late, approaching early evening.

"[All Royal Class students, please gather in the lobby. I repeat. All Royal Class students, please gather in the lobby.]"
Finally, the announcement calling all the Royal Class students had started broadcasting. I left my room at the far left and saw the backs of my fellow students as they walked away after hearing the announcement.

Elite or not.
Now, I have to act like a first-year high school student.
As the thought of needing to hurry crossed my mind, my footsteps felt heavy. I'm already tired.

In the lobby on the first floor, students from Class A and Class B had gathered, and the student council members were standing near the high staircase leading upstairs. And from each floor's railing, other students were observing us from above. The 6th-year students on the very top didn't even bother looking at us.
But this time, the upperclassmen were watching the arrival of the new students.
I wonder why.

"Now, line up in order from Room 1, both Class A and Class B."
Upon the student council president's words, everyone lined up in a row. It was not military-like precision; they were kids after all. I was at the back of Class A. Around the senior years, I no longer bother leaning against the railing to see the faces of the new students during events like this. But now, I'm observing everything. Right from the beginning, I noticed some differences from what I had expected.

"Now, let's have A-1 introduce themselves."
The student council president suggested.
"I am Vertus De Gradus!"

Just hearing that name sent shivers down my spine. It was the voice of the person who had almost killed me multiple times. Vertus De Gradus, an individual who should be considered a villain, had a lively and cheerful voice.

There was no sense of authority; instead, they were appealing to work hard.

It was strange. Vertus originally hid their identity and entered Temple, but now they were using their full name. That meant that the news of their entrance had spread through the Royal Class. And if that was the case, it meant that the upperclassmen were watching and observing the fact that the Crown Prince had enrolled.

Introduction continued, and when it was my turn, I briefly shouted my name. Naturally, nobody paid any attention to me.
"Now, shall we start with the introduction of Class B? Alright, B-1, please introduce yourself." 

The reason for the deviation from the previous path became clear. 

"I am Charlotte De Gradus."

A person who shouldn't have been here in the first place.
Charlotte was in the Temple Royal Class.
As her name was announced, I couldn't help but freeze for a moment. Charlotte De Gradus. She shouldn't be here, not in Temple's Royal Class. My mind raced trying to make sense of the situation.

The Crown Prince and Vertus De Gradus, both siblings, enrolled in the Royal Class? This was completely unexpected. It seemed that the upperclassmen were not just watching but closely observing the entrance of new students, especially those with such prominent backgrounds.

I couldn't help but feel a mixture of curiosity and unease. What would the presence of the Crown Prince and Charlotte De Gradus mean for the dynamics of the Royal Class? Would it upset the balance or bring new opportunities?

The introductions continued, and one by one, the students of Class A and Class B shared their names and brief remarks. Each introduction was met with varying degrees of interest or indifference.

As the introductions came to an end, the student council president clapped her hands to gain attention. "Thank you for the introductions, everyone. Let's all work hard and support each other during our time in the Royal Class. Remember, we are here to pursue excellence and uphold the values of Temple."

The atmosphere in the lobby was tense yet expectant. Now that the introductions were over, it was time for the real journey in the Royal Class to begin.
